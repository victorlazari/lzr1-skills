# Writing Functional Documentation

## When to use
- Writing a new guide or tutorial
- Creating conceptual documentation
- Documenting best practices
- Writing "how to" content

## Skip when
- Writing API reference → use write-api
- Reviewing documentation → use review-docs
- Writing code → use dev-team agents

## Sequence
**Runs before:** lzr1:review-docs

## Related
**Similar:** lzr1:write-api
**Complementary:** lzr1:voice-and-tone, lzr1:documentation-structure

Functional documentation explains concepts, guides users through workflows, and helps them understand "why" and "how" things work. This differs from API reference, which documents "what" each endpoint does.

## Document Types

| Type | Purpose | Key Sections |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Conceptual** | Explains core concepts and how things work | Definition → Key characteristics → How it works → Related concepts |
| **Getting Started** | First task with the product | Intro → Prerequisites → Numbered steps → Next steps |
| **How-To** | Task-focused for specific goals | Context → Before you begin → Steps → Verification → Troubleshooting |
| **Best Practices** | Optimal usage patterns | Intro → Practice sections (Mistake/Best practice) → Summary |

## Writing Patterns

### Lead with Value
Start every document with what the reader will learn or accomplish.

> ✅ This guide shows you how to create your first transaction in under 5 minutes.
>
> ❌ In this document, we will discuss the various aspects of transaction creation.

### Use Second Person
Address the reader directly.

> ✅ You can create as many accounts as your structure demands.
>
> ❌ Users can create as many accounts as their structure demands.

### Present Tense
Use for current behavior.

> ✅ Core one uses a microservices architecture.
>
> ❌ Core one will use a microservices architecture.

### Action-Oriented Headings
Indicate what the section covers or what users will do.

> ✅ Creating your first account
>
> ❌ Account creation process overview

### Short Paragraphs
2-3 sentences maximum. Use bullets for lists.

## Visual Elements

| Element | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| **Info box** | `> **Tip:** Helpful additional context` |
| **Warning box** | `> **Warning:** Important caution` |
| **Code examples** | Always include working examples for technical concepts |
| **Tables** | For compalzr1 options or structured data |

## Section Dividers

Use `---` to separate major sections. Improves scannability.

---

## Linking Patterns

- **Internal links:** Link concepts when first mentioned: "Each Account is linked to a single [Asset](link)"
- **API reference links:** Connect to API docs: "Manage via [API](link) or [Console](link)"
- **Next steps:** End guides with clear next steps
