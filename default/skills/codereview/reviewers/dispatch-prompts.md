### Standard Mode Dispatch

Use this dispatch when `review_state.slicing.enabled == false`.

**Scope header:** when `scope == "task"`, inject this block immediately after each review request heading:

```markdown
**REVIEW SCOPE: TASK-LEVEL**
This review covers the CUMULATIVE diff of task {task_id}, including changes from {N} subtasks: {subtask_ids}. Review the task as one integrated unit; subtask boundaries are implementation detail.
```

When `scope == "task"`, use `cumulative_diff_range.base_sha` and `cumulative_diff_range.head_sha` for every reviewer.

## Finding Eligibility Gate

Reviewers MUST NOT report slop findings. A finding is eligible only when all checks pass:

| Gate | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Changed or reachable diff | The issue is in changed code or code directly reachable from changed code. |
| Concrete impact path | The report explains what breaks, leaks, slows down, or becomes unmaintainable. |
| File:line evidence | The report cites exact file:line evidence, not generic advice. |
| Smaller recommendation | The recommended fix is smaller than the problem it solves. No architecture astronautics. |
| Domain-reachable edge case | Edge cases must be reachable in the product/domain flow, not hypothetical language trivia. |

If any gate fails, do not report the finding.

Each prompt receives:
- `unit_id`, `base_sha`, `head_sha`
- `implementation_summary`, `requirements`, `implementation_files`
- pre-analysis context for that reviewer when available
- explicit instruction: report findings only; do not modify files
