# Review Slicing Strategy

**Version:** 2.0.0

## Why We Slice

Large PRs that touch multiple themes (API handlers + infrastructure + migrations + domain logic) force every reviewer to parse the full diff. This causes **context pollution**: each reviewer wastes context window on irrelevant files and produces shallower analysis on the files that actually matter to their domain.

**The problem scales non-linearly.** A 10-file PR in one theme is reviewed deeply. A 40-file PR across 4 themes means each reviewer gets 1/4 of useful signal buried in 3/4 noise. Review quality degrades faster than PR size grows.

Slicing solves this by giving each reviewer a focused, thematic subset of the diff. Same total coverage, dramatically better depth per file.

**Note:** The adaptive slicer v2 evaluates whether context pollution is actually present, rather than assuming it from file count alone.

## When We Slice

The `lzr1:review-slicer` agent uses **three-phase adaptive reasoning** instead of rigid threshold tables:

### Phase 1: Volume Assessment (Hard Guardrails)

| Condition | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| < 5 files | **Never slice** | Unconditional. Full-diff review is optimal. Slicing overhead has zero benefit at this volume. |
| 40+ files | **Always slice** | Unconditional. No PR of this size benefits from full-diff review regardless of cohesion. |
| 5-39 files | **Proceed to Phase 2** | Volume alone is insufficient to decide. Cohesion analysis required. |

### Phase 2: Cohesion Analysis (5-39 files)

For changesets in the adaptive range, the slicer evaluates **semantic cohesion** across six dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Measures | High Cohesion Signal |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Package groupings | How many distinct packages/modules are touched | Files concentrated in 1-2 packages |
| Import relationships | Whether changed files import each other | Dense import graph among changed files |
| Naming patterns | Shared prefixes, suffixes, domain terms | Files share naming conventions (e.g., `order_*.go`) |
| Directory proximity | How close files are in the directory tree | Files clustered in adjacent directories |
| Functional relationships | Whether files collaborate on the same feature | Handler + service + repository for one entity |
| Diff concentration | Whether changes are spread thin or focused | Most hunks modify related logic |

### Phase 3: Cost-Benefit Judgment

The slicer makes a final decision based on whether slicing would **improve or degrade** review quality for the specific changeset:

- **High cohesion** → Don't slice. Splitting a cohesive changeset fractures context that reviewers need together.
- **Low cohesion** → Slice. Multiple unrelated themes benefit from focused review passes.
- **Mixed cohesion** → Slice, grouping cohesive files together into slices.

**Key insight:** File count is a volume signal, not a quality signal. Cohesion determines whether slicing helps. A 25-file PR touching one feature across handler/service/repo/test layers is best reviewed whole. A 12-file PR touching auth, billing, and migrations benefits from slicing.

## Enhanced Inputs

The adaptive slicer v2 receives enriched inputs that enable cohesion-based reasoning beyond simple file lists:

| Input | Format | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `package_map` | `{ "pkg/order": ["order.go", "order_test.go"], ... }` | Files grouped by Go package or TS module. Reveals package-level concentration. |
| `import_hints` | `{ "handler.go": ["service.go", "model.go"], ... }` | Adjacency list showing which changed files import each other. Reveals functional coupling. |
| `change_summary` | `{ "handler.go": ["func CreateOrder", "func UpdateOrder"], ... }` | Per-file hunk headers for semantic context. Reveals what each file actually changes. |

These inputs allow the slicer to assess cohesion structurally rather than relying on directory heuristics or file count alone. When `import_hints` show dense cross-references among changed files, that is a strong signal to keep them together. When `package_map` reveals 5+ unrelated packages with no shared imports, that is a strong signal to slice.

## Why All 9 Reviewers on All Slices

**Key design decision: every reviewer runs on every slice. No "relevant reviewer" routing.**

The temptation is to route only "relevant" reviewers per slice — send `lzr1:security-reviewer` to the API slice but skip it for infrastructure. This is wrong for three reasons:

### 1. The Best Findings Are the Unexpected Ones

A security reviewer scanning a migration file might catch a privilege escalation path nobody else would flag. A nil-safety reviewer looking at infrastructure config might spot a missing null check in a template variable. Routing by "relevance" optimizes for the expected and kills the unexpected.

### 2. Cross-Cutting Concerns Are Invisible to Routing

Authorization logic might live in middleware (API slice) but depend on database roles defined in migrations (migration slice). Reviewers need independent slice visibility to catch cross-cutting dependencies.

### 3. Cost Difference Is Negligible

9 default reviewers on 1 full diff = 9 calls, each processing N files of context.
9 default reviewers on 3 slices = 27 calls, each processing ~N/3 files of context, plus triggered specialists per slice.

Total tokens processed is roughly equivalent. The per-call cost is lower (smaller context = faster inference, fewer irrelevant tokens). The marginal increase in API calls is offset by better quality per call.

## How Slicing Works

### Grouping Strategy

Files are grouped by **semantic theme**, not blindly by directory:

| Theme | Description | Example Patterns |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `api-handlers` | HTTP/gRPC handlers, middleware, routing | `*/api/*`, `*/handler*`, `*/route*`, `*/middleware*` |
| `domain-models` | Entities, value objects, business rules | `*/domain/*`, `*/model*`, `*/entity*`, `*/service/*` |
| `infrastructure` | Helm charts, K8s manifests, CI/CD | `charts/*`, `k8s/*`, `.github/*`, `Dockerfile*` |
| `migrations` | Database schema changes | `*/migration*`, `*/schema*`, `*.sql` |
| `tests` | Standalone test infrastructure | `testutil/*`, `test/*` (not co-located tests) |
| `config` | Application configuration, bootstrap | `cmd/*/main.go`, `*.toml`, `*.env*` |
| `documentation` | Non-code documentation | `*.md`, `docs/*` |

### Co-Location Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Test files MUST be co-located with the production code they test.** If `handler.go` is in the `api-handlers` slice, then `handler_test.go` goes in that same slice. The test-reviewer MUST see code + tests together to assess coverage.

### Constraints

- A file appears in exactly **one** slice (no duplication)
- Target **2-5 slices** (merge smallest if > 5)
- Every slice has at least 1 file
- Ambiguous files go to the closest match by directory proximity

---

## How Deduplication Works

When the selected review pool runs on N slices, the same issue might surface multiple times. The consolidation step deduplicates before presenting results:

### Exact Match Dedup

**Same reviewer + same file:line** across different invocations (e.g., re-run) = keep one instance.

### Fuzzy Match Dedup

**Different reviewers or different slices + same file:line + description similarity > 80%** = keep the more detailed finding. Note which reviewers flagged it (higher confidence signal).

### Cross-Cutting Detection

**Same issue found across multiple slices** = flag as **"cross-cutting concern"**. This is a high-value signal: it often indicates an architectural issue (e.g., a broken interface contract affecting both API and domain slices). Cross-cutting issues are surfaced prominently in the consolidated report.

### Dedup Preserves Signal

Dedup removes noise, not signal. Two different reviewers catching the same issue from different angles is stronger evidence, not redundancy. The consolidated report notes "found by N reviewers" to convey confidence.

## Cost Analysis

| Scenario | API Calls | Context per Call | Total Tokens | Review Quality |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **No slicing** (40-file PR) | 9 | ~40 files each | 9 x FULL | Shallow (noise dilutes signal) |
| **3 slices** (40-file PR) | 27 | ~13 files each | 27 x (FULL/3) ~ 9 x FULL | Deep (focused context per slice) |
| **5 slices** (40-file PR) | 45 | ~8 files each | 45 x (FULL/5) ~ 9 x FULL | Deepest (most focused) |

**Key insight:** Total tokens processed is approximately constant. We're redistributing the same work into focused chunks, not adding work.

**Slicer overhead (v2):** The adaptive slicer uses a **Sonnet-class model** for reasoning capability (upgraded from Flash/Haiku). Latency target is **< 15 seconds** (up from < 5s in v1). This is justified because the slicer runs **once per review**, and its decision shapes **9 x N downstream reviewer calls**. A better slice/no-slice decision at 15s saves far more than 10s of slicer time when it prevents unnecessary sliced dispatches or avoids context pollution in full-diff mode. Token cost per slicer call is slightly higher, but potentially fewer unnecessary sliced dispatches save downstream tokens when full-diff is actually optimal.

## Integration Points

### With Mithril Pre-Analysis

The slicer runs **after** Mithril completes. Mithril context files are filtered per slice: each reviewer receives only the Mithril analysis sections that mention files in their slice. This keeps pre-analysis context focused too.

### With Reviewer Dispatch

When slicing is active:
- `implementation_files` passed to each reviewer = the slice's file list, not the full list
- Git diff is scoped: `git diff [base_sha] [head_sha] -- [slice files...]`
- All 9 default reviewers still dispatch in parallel per slice; triggered specialists join the same batch

### With Consolidation

The consolidation step (Step 4 of the review skill) merges all slice results before presenting to the user. The output format is unchanged — the user sees a unified review report, not per-slice fragments. The only visible difference is a note:

> "Review was sliced into N thematic groups for deeper analysis."

---

## Transparency to Users

**The user never manages slices.** Slicing is an internal optimization:

- Small PRs: No slicing, no mention of slicing. Zero overhead.
- Large PRs: Slicing happens automatically. Report notes "sliced into N groups."
- The consolidated report is identical in structure to a non-sliced review.
- Per-slice details are available in `review_state.slices` for debugging but not surfaced by default.

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Route only relevant reviewers per slice" | Unexpected findings > efficiency. All defaults, all slices. | **Dispatch all 9 defaults on every slice** |
| "Skip slicing, reviewers can handle large diffs" | Context pollution degrades quality non-linearly | **Apply adaptive slicer. Respect hard guardrails and cohesion analysis.** |
| "Slice into too many themes for maximum focus" | > 5 slices = overhead exceeds benefit | **Merge to stay within 2-5** |
| "Separate tests into their own slice" | Reviewers need code + tests together | **Co-locate tests with production code** |
| "Dedup removes too many findings" | Dedup removes duplicates, not unique findings | **Dedup by file:line + similarity only** |
| "Cohesion analysis takes too long, just count files" | Volume-only decisions are the old model. Cohesion analysis is mandatory for the 5-39 file range. | **MUST run cohesion analysis for adaptive range. Hard guardrails handle extremes.** |
| "Import hints aren't available, skip cohesion" | Missing inputs degrade analysis but do not eliminate it. | **Fall back to conservative mode: favor no-slice for medium counts, slice for high counts. MUST note degraded analysis in reasoning.** |
