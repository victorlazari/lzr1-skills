# When Review is Not Needed

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Applies to:** All reviewer agents

---

## Minimal Review Conditions

Review can be MINIMAL (not skipped) when ALL these conditions are met:

| Condition | Verification Required |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Documentation-only changes** | Verify .md files only, no code changes |
| **Pure formatting/whitespace** | Verify no logic modifications via git diff |
| **Generated/lock files only** | Verify package-lock.json, go.sum, etc. |
| **Reverts previous commit** | Reference original review that approved reverted code |

**IMPORTANT:** "Minimal" means reduced scope, NOT skipped review.

---

## Still Required in Minimal Mode

Even in minimal mode, these checks are MANDATORY:

| File Type | Required Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Generated config files** | Verify correctness, no security issues |
| **Lock file changes** | Verify no security vulnerabilities introduced |
| **Dependency version bumps** | Check for CVEs in new versions |
| **Revert commits** | Confirm revert is intentional, not accidental |
| **Database migrations** | ALWAYS full review (data integrity risk) |
| **Auth/authz code** | ALWAYS full review (security risk) |
| **State machine changes** | ALWAYS full review (business logic risk) |

---

## Domain-Specific "Not Needed" Criteria

### Code Reviewer
- Documentation-only changes (no code)
- Formatting/whitespace only (no logic)
- Generated files only (package-lock, etc.)

### Business Logic Reviewer
- Documentation/comments only (no executable code)
- Pure formatting (whitespace changes)
- Configuration values only (no business rule changes)

**STILL REQUIRED:** Configuration changes affecting business rules, database migrations, workflow changes

### Security Reviewer
- Documentation-only (no executable content)
- Pure formatting (no logic changes)
- Previous security review covers same scope in same PR

**STILL REQUIRED:** Dependency changes (even version bumps), configuration changes (secrets exposure risk), auth/authz logic

### Test Reviewer
- Changes to non-test code only (test files unchanged)
- Test configuration only (no test logic)

**STILL REQUIRED:** Any changes to test files, new functionality without tests

### Nil-Safety Reviewer
- Changes to documentation only
- Test file changes (no production code)
- Pure type annotation changes (no runtime behavior)

**STILL REQUIRED:** Any production code changes in Go or TypeScript

### Dead Code Reviewer
- New additive-only code (no removals or refactolzr1)
- Documentation-only changes
- Configuration-only changes

**STILL REQUIRED:** Function removal, refactolzr1, inlining, type changes, endpoint removal

## Decision Framework

```
Is it documentation/comments only?
├── YES → Minimal review (verify no executable content)
└── NO → Continue

Is it formatting/whitespace only?
├── YES → Minimal review (verify via git diff)
└── NO → Continue

Is it generated/lock files only?
├── YES → Minimal review (check for vulnerabilities)
└── NO → Continue

Is it in critical category (auth, DB, state machine)?
├── YES → FULL REVIEW REQUIRED
└── NO → Continue

Does it touch code in my domain?
├── YES → FULL REVIEW REQUIRED
└── NO → Minimal review
```

---

## When in Doubt

**ALWAYS conduct full review.**

- Missed issues compound over time
- Business logic errors are expensive
- Security vulnerabilities are catastrophic
- The cost of full review < cost of missed bug

---

## Anti-Rationalization

Do NOT skip review because:

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "It's just a config change" | Config can affect behavior, expose secrets |
| "Tests don't need review" | Tests can be wrong, test mock behavior |
| "It's a minor version bump" | Minor versions can introduce breaking changes |
| "Previous PR reviewed this" | Each PR is independent, code may have changed |
| "It's already in production" | Production duration ≠ correctness |

**Default:** Full review. Minimal review is the exception, not the rule.
