# Autonomous Multi-Phase Codebase Exploration

## When to use
- Need to understand how a feature/system works across the codebase
- Starting work on unfamiliar codebase or component
- Planning changes that span multiple layers/components
- User asks "how does X work?" for non-trivial X
- Need architecture understanding before implementation

## Skip when
- Pure reference lookup (function signature, type definition)
- Checking if specific file exists (yes/no question)
- Reading error message from known file location

## Sequence
**Runs before:** lzr1:write-plan

## Related
**Similar:** dispatching-parallel-agents

Multi-phase approach: **Phase 0 scopes** the target, **Phase 1 discovers** the natural structure of the codebase, **Phase 2 deep-dives** into each discovered area in parallel, **Phase 3 collects** results, and **Phase 4 synthesizes** findings.

**Announce at start:** "Using lzr1:explore-codebase for multi-phase autonomous exploration."

## How It Works

```
Phase 1: Discovery (3-4 parallel agents)
  → Architecture, Components, Layers, Organization

Phase 2: Deep Dive (N adaptive agents, one per discovered perspective)
  → Target implementation in each area

Phase 3: Synthesis → Actionable guidance with file:line evidence
```

## Phase 0: Scope Definition

Extract from user request: core subject, context/intent, depth needed. Set exploration boundaries (include/exclude directories).

## Phase 1: Discovery Pass

### ⛔ STOP-CHECK BEFORE DISPATCH

Before emitting any Task call, count the discovery agents you intend to launch in this turn.
- Count MUST equal the number of discovery perspectives you scoped (typically 3-4: Architecture, Components, Layers, Organization).
- If your dispatch count diverges from your scoped count → STOP and reconcile.
- No substitutions, no omissions.

### ⛔ MUST NOT trickle-dispatch

All discovery agents leave in the SAME TURN, before reading any agent output.

Forbidden sequences:
- Dispatch agent 1 → read result → dispatch agent 2
- Dispatch a subset → wait → dispatch the rest
- Dispatch follow-up agents conditioned on partial output
- Loop sequentially over the discovery angles

If you find yourself about to dispatch a discovery agent in a turn AFTER any agent has already returned a result → STOP. You violated parallel dispatch. Report the violation and mark the phase INCOMPLETE rather than completing the trickle.

### Self-verify after dispatch

After the dispatch turn, verify all scoped Task calls were emitted in that single turn. If fewer went out than scoped, the phase did NOT execute correctly. Mark INCOMPLETE and surface the dispatch failure — do NOT silently continue with a partial pool.

### Parallel dispatch — atomic batch

Emit all scoped Task calls (the count established in the STOP-CHECK above) in a SINGLE TURN, as one atomic batch.

**If your runtime exposes a `multi_tool_use.parallel` wrapper**, use it to dispatch the complete pool in one wrapped invocation. This is the canonical fan-out mechanism on OpenAI-style tool envelopes and on certain Anthropic SDK consumers — naming it explicitly activates parallel emission on runtimes where trickle-dispatch is the default behavior.

**If your runtime emits parallel tool_use blocks natively** (Claude Code with Claude models), `multi_tool_use.parallel` may not be needed — but naming it is harmless and serves as an enforcement anchor.

The STOP-CHECK, anti-trickle, and self-verify guards above remain binding regardless of which mechanism your runtime uses.

**Dispatch 3-4 discovery agents in a SINGLE turn (parallel):**

**Architecture Discovery:** Find pattern (Hexagonal, Layered, Microservices, Monolith, etc.). Evidence: top-level directory structure, layer separation, file paths. Output: pattern name + confidence + ASCII diagram.

**Component Discovery:** Identify all major components/modules. For each: name, location, responsibility, tech stack, size. Map dependencies between components.

**Layer Discovery:** Within each component, identify layers (HTTP/API, Business Logic, Data Access, Infrastructure). Document how layers are separated and how they communicate.

**Organization Discovery:** Find organizing principle (by layer vs by feature vs by domain). Document file naming conventions, test organization, config locations.

**After Phase 1:** Validate quality — all areas have file:line evidence, no major "unknowns" remain. Determine how many deep-dive agents to launch (one per discovered perspective).

<example>
3-component system → 3 deep-dive agents
4-layer monolith → 4 deep-dive agents (one per layer)
6-service microservices → 6 deep-dive agents
</example>

## Phase 2: Deep Dive Pass

### ⛔ STOP-CHECK BEFORE DISPATCH

Before emitting any Task call, count the deep-dive agents you intend to launch in this turn.
- Count MUST equal the number of perspectives discovered in Phase 1.
- If your dispatch count diverges from your scoped count → STOP and reconcile.
- One agent per discovered perspective. No substitutions, no omissions.

### ⛔ MUST NOT trickle-dispatch

All deep-dive agents leave in the SAME TURN, before reading any agent output.

Forbidden sequences:
- Dispatch agent 1 → read result → dispatch agent 2
- Dispatch a subset → wait → dispatch the rest
- Dispatch follow-up agents conditioned on partial output
- Loop sequentially over the perspective list

If you find yourself about to dispatch a deep-dive agent in a turn AFTER any agent has already returned a result → STOP. You violated parallel dispatch. Report the violation and mark the phase INCOMPLETE rather than completing the trickle.

### Self-verify after dispatch

After the dispatch turn, verify all scoped Task calls were emitted in that single turn. If fewer went out than scoped, the phase did NOT execute correctly. Mark INCOMPLETE and surface the dispatch failure — do NOT silently continue with a partial pool.

### Parallel dispatch — atomic batch

Emit all scoped Task calls (the count established in the STOP-CHECK above) in a SINGLE TURN, as one atomic batch.

**If your runtime exposes a `multi_tool_use.parallel` wrapper**, use it to dispatch the complete pool in one wrapped invocation. This is the canonical fan-out mechanism on OpenAI-style tool envelopes and on certain Anthropic SDK consumers — naming it explicitly activates parallel emission on runtimes where trickle-dispatch is the default behavior.

The STOP-CHECK, anti-trickle, and self-verify guards above remain binding regardless of which mechanism your runtime uses.

**Dispatch N adaptive agents in a SINGLE turn (parallel).** One agent per discovered perspective.

Each agent prompt includes:
- Discovered context (architecture, component responsibility, location)
- Specific target to find
- Scope boundaries (directory, depth)

Each agent traces the target through: entry points → execution flow (with file:line) → data transformations → integration points.

## Phase 3: Result Collection

Organize results into Discovery (structure) and Deep Dive (target implementation per area). Cross-reference: do deep dive findings align with Phase 1 structure? Note gaps explicitly.

## Phase 4: Synthesis

Integrate findings into a unified document:

```markdown
# Codebase Exploration: [Target]

## Executive Summary
[Architecture + how target works — 2-3 sentences]

## Phase 1: Discovery Findings
### Architecture Pattern | Component Structure | Layer Organization | Tech Stack | Diagram

## Phase 2: Deep Dive Findings
### [Discovered Area 1]
- Entry point: file:line
- Flow: step-by-step with file:line
- Patterns: [observed]
- Integration: [connections]

### [Discovered Area 2]
[same structure]

## Cross-Cutting Insights
### Pattern Consistency | Variations | Integration Points | Data Flow | Key Decisions

## Implementation Guidance
### Adding new functionality: where, patterns to follow, integration requirements
### Modifying existing: files to change, ripple effects
### Debugging: starting points, data inspection points, common failures
```

## Phase 5: Action Recommendations

Context-aware next steps based on user's goal:
- **Implementation** → suggest lzr1:write-plan with discovered entry points
- **Debugging** → investigation starting points with file:line
- **Learning** → reading path through key files

## Discovery Agent Templates

### Architecture Agent
```
Goal: Discover architecture pattern.
Examine top-level structure. Identify: Hexagonal/Layered/Microservices/Monolith/MVC/Other.
Provide: pattern name, directory evidence, key paths, confidence level, ASCII diagram.
```

### Component Agent
```
Goal: Identify all major components/modules.
For each component: name, path, responsibility, stack, size.
Map dependencies. Identify shared libraries.
```

### Layer Agent
```
Goal: Discover layers within components.
For each layer: name, location, responsibility, dependencies.
Check for layer violations. Document communication patterns (DI, interfaces, direct).
```

### Organization Agent
```
Goal: Find organizing principle.
Identify: by-layer vs by-feature vs by-domain.
Document: file naming conventions, test co-location, config locations.
```

## Deep Dive Agent Template

```
Goal: Explore [TARGET] in [DISCOVERED_PERSPECTIVE].
Context: architecture=[X], component=[Y], location=[Z], responsibility=[R].
Task:
1. Find [TARGET] — entry points with file:line
2. Trace execution flow — each step with file:line
3. Document patterns — error handling, validation, testing
4. Identify integration points — inbound/outbound with file:line
Scope: Stay within [directory]. Maximum depth: [based on layer].
Output: entry points, execution flow, patterns, integration points, key files.
```
